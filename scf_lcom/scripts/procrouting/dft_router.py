def build_lcom_superfunctional(functional_dict: dict, restricted, )
    '''
        Builds a LCOM superfunctional from a functional dictionary. 
        
        Note that this would replace the default PSI4 implementation for the functional 
        dict builder. So any calls to this function would need to restore the original
        function for functionality to be preserved.
